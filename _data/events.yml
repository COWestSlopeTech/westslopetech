  description: Marketing is probably one of the fastest changing industries out there and most of us need to know something about it in order to get our products, services, and ideas out there. This month we have local marketing professional Eric Whiting coming to talk about the current state of marketing and some of the tools out there to help be more successful. There will be a special emphasis on the digital aspects of marketing which often are the most perplexing. <br><br> Eric currently works for Backbone Media and is co-founder of Iron Will Outfitters. He's also worked for larger organizations and so will come with a breadth of experience that will likely relate to many of us.
