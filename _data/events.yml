  description: Marketing is probably one of the fastest changing industries out there and most of us need to know something about it in order to get our products, services, and ideas out there. This month we have local marketing professional Eric Whiting coming to talk about the current state of marketing and some of the tools out there to help be more successful. There will be a special emphasis on the digital aspects of marketing which often are the most perplexing. <br><br> Eric currently works for Backbone Media and is co-founder of Iron Will Outfitters. He's also worked for larger organizations and so will come with a breadth of experience that will likely relate to many of us.

  description: There have been a couple talks on BlockChain technology around the Roaring Fork recently and the latest by Jeremy Cerise dove a little bit deeper into how a basic BlockChain works. This meetup is going to be a technical introduction to the Etherium BlockChain environment targeted at implementing an Etherium project as a developer. There will probably be some collaborative coding but in general we are going to introduce the Ethereum ecosystem and setup a 'hello world' initial app.<br><br>This meetup is targeting the skill building goals of the Roaring Fork Technologists where we all work together to help learn and/or grow relevant skills that help us in our careers.

  description: In collaboration with <a href="https://glenx.space/" target="_blank">GlenX</a> and <a href="https://aspenentrepreneurs.com/" target="_blank">Aspen Entrepreneurs</a> we are hosting a special happy hour & picnic style event that combines a talk from three special visiting speakers with lot's of time to discuss the topics more informally afterward. I will be cooking food for all at the Third Street Center's pizza oven/bbq pavilion to ensure we celebrate a beautiful spring Friday evening appropriately. This is going to be good! <br><br> The technology industry touches many aspects of our personal and professional lives that go well beyond social media. There are many technology professionals working to help public organizations better support, engage, and plan for the citizens they represent. This requires a diversity of skills and backgrounds that collectively seek to build meaningful solutions for the greater good. <br><br> At this event we have three special guests that collectively cover a broad spectrum of technical skills in a variety of disciplines. Ashley Summers, Shilo Rohlman, and Andrea Santoro will talk about there perspective as professional women in their careers where they have worked as urban planners, software engineers, GIS professionals, project managers, and IT managers for both public and private organizations. A central theme to their collective experience will be how they all supported urban planning efforts while working for different organizations in the Denver/Boulder Front Range.  Their efforts have touched communities large and small. <br><br> <b>Ashley Summers</b> is the Information Systems Manager at the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) where she leads a hybrid team of GIS professionals and application developers. She holds a Masters degree from Texas State University in Geographic Information Science and a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Texas at Austin in Geography. She is a certified Project Management Professional (PMP) and currently teaches GIS Project Management at the University of Colorado. Her current role with the DRCOG is heavily involved in supporting decision makers around the Colorado Front Range with digital tools that address challenges with planning, transportation modeling, land use modeling, and more. She enjoys hiking, yoga, and world travel. <br><br> <b>Shilo Rohlman</b> has a long history of building software for both the government and private sectors. She's helped build innovative visualization solutions for the City & County of Denver, worked for the biggest GIS software company in the world (ESRI), and helped build technology platforms for startups. She's no stranger to software development and many of the aspects that are needed to build solutions for organizations of all types. <br><br> <b>Andrea Santoro</b> discovered GIS in the early 2000’s and fell in love with its ability to communicate complex geospatial information visually. Since then, she’s been exploring new ways to apply GIS technology to various environmental, planning, and transportation issues. Andrea holds a Masters Degree in Geographic Information Science from the University of Denver and a Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology from Arizona State University. She has worked for various consulting firms and government agencies, including the City and County of Denver’s Community Planning and Development Department where she utilized GIS to promote healthy and sustainable urban environments. More recently, she has taken an interest in sharing her knowledge and experience with others through education, and is currently working as an Instructor for Esri in the Broomfield, CO office.

  description: At the April regular meetup we learned some of the basics of the Etherium ecosystem and worked through an example putting coins in a smart contract and then allowing the transfer of those coins to an external account. This month we'll build on this by building out a super simple testing framework and user interface using React/Web3/Ganache. <br><br>This will be fun and collaborative. You do not need to have experience with Ethereum, Blockchain technology or coding at all. This is an opportunity to get your hands dirty with code if you want or just see how these new technologies work under the hood.

  description: The digital world as we know is built on open source software yet it's still a challenge to fund open source projects. Typically the biggest and most used open source projects are supported through large organizations that can support a project that serves the interests of the organization. GitCoin offers an innovative opportunity to fund open source projects while mitigating the need for support from large organizations. This can help fill functionality gaps in large projects while also providing funding sources for smaller projects. <br><br> Another exciting aspect to GitCoin is the opportunity it provides to open source contributors living in rural communities. By implementing funded features a person can generate additional income while at the same time supporting the open source community. One day it might be possible to rely on GitCoin as a primary income source making it more possible to live in mountain communities than ever before.

  description: It's been an action packed year so far in the Roaring Fork! At our last meetup we had an impromptu re-evaluation of the goals and strategy for the Technologists. We would like to continue that conversation at this meetup. Since we will have a guest speaker coming the day before (Monday the 13th) we would like to keep this meetup more casual by focusing more on re-connecting than heavy content. <br><br> Come meetup to have drinks and help provide feedback on how to shape the rest of the year!

  description: To celebrate the end of the year, and a lot of successes, we're hosting an end of the year party combined with a community app contest. This will be a fun way to celebrate while turning some of your ideas into reality with a group of fellow supportive Technologists. You don't have to participate in the App Contest to celebrate with us but we do encourage you to come to the pitch night to support ideas and see if you end up staying to help a team. You do NOT need to know how to write code to be on a team. Diversity of skills are often important for success.
