#   description: Marketing is probably one of the fastest changing industries out there and most of us need to know something about it in order to get our products, services, and ideas out there. This month we have local marketing professional Eric Whiting coming to talk about the current state of marketing and some of the tools out there to help be more successful. There will be a special emphasis on the digital aspects of marketing which often are the most perplexing. <br><br> Eric currently works for Backbone Media and is co-founder of Iron Will Outfitters. He's also worked for larger organizations and so will come with a breadth of experience that will likely relate to many of us.

  description: The technology industry touches many aspects of our personal and professional lives that go well beyond social media. There are many technology professionals working to help public organizations better support, engage, and plan for the citizens they represent. This requires a diversity of skills and backgrounds that collectively seek to build meaningful solutions for the greater good. <br><br> At this event we have three special guests that collectively cover a broad spectrum of technical skills in a variety of disciplines. Ashley Summers, Shilo Rohlman, and Andrea Santoro will talk about there perspective as professional women in their careers where they have worked as urban planners, software engineers, GIS professionals, project managers, and IT managers for both public and private organizations. A central theme to their collective experience will be how they all supported urban planning efforts while working for different organizations in the Denver/Boulder Front Range.  Their efforts have touched communities large and small.
