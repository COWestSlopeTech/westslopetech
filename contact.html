      <h3>Are you a student looking for help on a project?</h3>
      <p>
        We are happy to help you in whatever way we can on technical projects. Because we each have different specialties that often overlap it's best if you reach out to us digitally so more people can hear what you need. If you reach out on Slack (see below) look for the #mentor-support channel to start asking questions.
      </p>

      <h3>Are you a local entrepeneur looking for someone to answer technical questions related to your business?</h3>
      <p>
        We are happy to sit down for coffee and try to answer questions you have about technology in your business. We are not offering a paid or complete consulting service. We are simply local technology professionals that would be happy to help orient you in a way that helps minimize barriers you may have.
      </p>

      <h3>Are you a technology professional looking to be part of a community of other technology professionals?</h3>
      <p>
        Great! The first thing you should do is join our Facebook group (link below) and say hi. If you don't use Facebook send us an email or come to one of our events to get to know us. We're always super happy to meet new friends.

      <h4>Slack</h4>
      <p>
        The best way to get support is through our Slack channel because it's the most efficient way for you to ask a group of professionals technical questions. Slack is a glorified instant messanger so it's pretty simple. Once signed up feel free to ask any question you have in either a channel that seems most relevant or the #general channel. There are no dumb questions. We're here to help.

      <h4>Facebook</h4>
      <p>
        While Slack is more direct there are more people on the Facebook group. You can join the group to ask questions to everyone or send a direct message to any of the group members you think might be able to help.
